## üöÄ How It Works  

The project's workflow consists of several key steps, each designed to build towards creating an accurate and effective brain tumor classification model:  

1. Data Loading & Preprocessing: The process starts with loading and preprocessing a dataset of MRI brain scans. Images are resized, normalized, and augmented to help the model generalize better across various input scenarios.  
   
2. Model Architecture: A custom CNN architecture is constructed, optimized for feature extraction from MRI images, effectively capturing the complex patterns indicative of tumors.  
   
3. Training & Evaluation: The model is systematically trained using a labeled dataset of MRI scans, with performance metrics such as accuracy and loss tracked throughout the training epochs.  
   
4. Prediction & Classification: Finally, the model is utilized to predict the presence or absence of tumors in new MRI scans, offering insights based on previously learned features.
